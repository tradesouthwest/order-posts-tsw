Allows posts to be arranged on page in a defined manner.

== Description ==
Posts of any post_type may be sorted and displayed on the front-end of your site by a predefined order that can be set in the administrator editor pages. Will work for any post type and can be sorted to view in an arbitrary manner or a very specific manner according to your choice. The only sort order that this plugin does not support is to sort posts by category or tag. This is a option that is already built into WordPress archive paging core functionality.

This plugin extends the ability to go beyond the standard “Sticky” post option that is part of the editor. Sticky posts are the posts in your blog pages that can be assigned to be displayed in your blog as the first posts that a visitor to your site will see. Order Posts gives the the flexibility to have multiple Sticky post with the ability to select the display order manually. Every post will have a hidden custom field that you can assign a number to. The higher the number, the farther down the list of posts your post will show up.
